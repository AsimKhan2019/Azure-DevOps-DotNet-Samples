### Sample snippet contributions

For client library sample snippets, review and follow the [snippet contribution guidance](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-dotnet-samples/blob/master/ClientLibrary/Snippets/contribute.md)

* [ ] Follow organization guidelines
* [ ] Use real types (avoids `var`)
* [ ] Use `Context.Log` (avoids Console.WriteLine)
* [ ] Sample should clean up resources they create
* [ ] Avoid samples that arbitrarily destroy data
